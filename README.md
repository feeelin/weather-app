Application to get the current weather forecast for the entered city. 

## Goals
This project was a collaborative effort between students in the Python32 group while learning the fundamentals of team-based software development and agile methodologies. During its development, students had to perform tasks, go through code review, 
ensure code coverage with tests, and interact with each other to produce results.
